/**
 * The backend for a {@link Layouter}.  An object satisfying this
 * interface can act as a receiver for the layed out text produced by
 * a {@link Layouter}.  A <code>Backend</code> must also provide the
 * maximum line width available through the {@link #lineWidth()}
 * method.  Finally, it is responsible for calculating (with {@link
 * #measure(String)} the amount of space it actually needs to print a
 * given string.  For instance, if strings printed through a {@link
 * Layouter} are actually known to be in HTML, {@link
 * #measure(String)} can return the size of the text, not including
 * markup.
 *
 * <P>This interface has a type parameter <code>Exc</code> which
 * denotes the type of exceptions that might be thrown when output is
 * sent to a backend.  For instance, a backend like {@link
 * WriterBackend}, which ultimately writes output to a {@link
 * java.io.Writer} might produce <code>IOException</code>s which
 * should not be handled by the Backend, but passed through to the
 * program calling the {@link Layouter}.  So it implements the
 * interface <code>Backend&lt;java.io.IOException&gt;</code>.  There is a dummy
 * exception class {@link NoExceptions} that may be used as parameter
 * if no checked exceptions are thrown by a Backend.
 *
 * <P>There is currently no provision to handle proportional fonts,
 * and there might never be.
 *
 * @param <Exc> The type of exceptions that might be thrown by 
 * this backend.
