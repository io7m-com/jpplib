    A package to pretty-print information using line breaks and
    indentation.  For instance, it can be used to print
    <pre>
    while (i>0) {
      i--;
      j++;
    }
    </pre>
    instead of 
    <pre>
    while (i>0) { i
    --; j++;}
    </pre>

    if a maximum line width of 15 characters is chosen.  The frontend
to the Pretty-Printer is the {@link de.uka.ilkd.pp.Layouter} class.
You may configure what happens with the output by implemenenting the
{@link de.uka.ilkd.pp.Backend} interface, or by using one of the
standard implementations {@link de.uka.ilkd.pp.StringBackend} and
{@link de.uka.ilkd.pp.WriterBackend}.
