/**
 * Pretty-print information formatted using line breaks and indentation. For
 * instance, this class can be used to print
 * 
 * <pre>
 * while (i &gt; 0) {
 *   i--;
 *   j++;
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * instead of
 * 
 * <pre>
 * while (i &gt; 0) { i
 * --; j++;}
 * </pre>
 * 
 * if a maximum line width of 15 characters is chosen.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The formatted output is directed to a <em>backend</em> which might write it
 * to an I/O stream, append it to the text of a GUI componenet or store it in a
 * string. The {@link Backend} interface encapsulates the concept of backend.
 * Apart from handling the output, the backend is also asked for the available
 * line width and for the amount of space needed to print a string. This makes
 * it possible to include e.g. HTML markup in the output which does not take up
 * any space. There are two convenience implementations {@link WriterBackend}
 * and {@link StringBackend}, which write the output to a
 * {@link java.io.Writer}, resp. a {@link java.lang.String}.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The layouter internally keeps track of a current <em>indentation
 * level</em>.
 * Think of nicely indented Java source code. Then the indentation level at any
 * point is the number of blank columns to be inserted at the begining of the
 * next line if you inserted a line break. To increase the indentation level of
 * parts of the text, the input to the layouter is separated into
 * <em>blocks</em>. The indentation level changes when a block is begun, and
 * it is reset to its previous value when a block is ended. Of course, blocks
 * maybe nested.
 * 
 * In order to break text among several lines, the layouter needs to be told
 * where line breaks are allowed. A <em>break</em> is a position in the text
 * where there is either a line break (with appropriate indentation) or a number
 * of spaces, if enough material fits in one line. In order to handle the
 * indentation level properly, breaks should only occur inside blocks. There are
 * in fact two kinds of blocks: <em>consistent</em> and <em>inconsistent</em>
 * ones. In a consistent block, lines are broken either at all or at none of the
 * breaks. In an inconsistent block, as much material as possible is put on one
 * line before it is broken.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Consider the program above. It should be printed either as
 * 
 * <pre>
 * while (i &gt; 0) { i--; j++; }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * or, if there is not enough space on the line, as
 * 
 * <pre>
 * while (i &gt; 0) {
 *   i--;
 *   j++;
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Given a Layouter object <code>l</code>, we could say:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * l.beginC(2).print("while (i&gt;0) {").brk(1,0)
 *  .print("i--;").brk(1,0)
 *  .print("j++;").brk(1,-2)
 *  .print("}").end();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The call to {@link #beginC(int)} starts a consistent block, advancing the
 * indentation level by 2, relative to the current position in the line.
 * The {@link #print(String)} methods gives some actual
 * text to be output. The call to {@link #brk(int,int)} inserts a break. The
 * first argument means that one space should be printed at this position if the
 * line is <em>not</em> broken. The second argument is an offset to be added
 * to the indentation level for the next line, if the line <em>is</em> broken.
 * The effect of this parameter can be seen in the call <code>brk(1,-2)</code>.
 * The offset of <code>-2</code> outdents the last line by 2 positions, which
 * aligns the closing brace with the <code>while</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the lines in a block are broken, one sometimes wants to insert spaces up
 * to the current indentation level at a certain position without allowing a
 * line break there. This can be done using the {@link #ind(int,int)} method.
 * For instance, one wants to output either
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   ...[Good and Bad and Ugly]...
 * </pre>
 * 
 * or
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   ...[    Good
 *       and Bad
 *       and Ugly]...
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Note the four spaces required before <code>Good</code>. We do this by
 * opening a block which sets the indentation level to the column where the
 * <code>G</code> ends up and outdenting the lines with the <code>and</code>:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * l.print(&quot;...[&quot;).beginC(4).ind(0, 0).print(&quot;Good&quot;).brk(1, -4).print(&quot;and &quot;)
 * 		.print(&quot;Bad&quot;).brk(1, -4).print(&quot;and &quot;).print(&quot;Ugly&quot;).end()
 * 		.print(&quot;]...&quot;);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Again, the first argument to {@link #ind(int,int)} is a number of spaces to
 * print if the block we are in is printed on one line. The second argument is
 * an offset to be added to the current indentation level to determine the
 * column to which we should skip.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When all text has been sent to a Layouter and all blocks have been ended, the
 * {@link #close()} method should be closed. This sends all pending output to
 * the backend and invokes the {@link Backend#close()} method, which usually
 * closes I/O streams, etc.
 * 
 * <P>The indentation level of a new block can be increased either relative to
 * the current position on the line, or relative to the surrounding block's
 * indentation level.  Using the current position is useful e.g. to produce output 
 * like
 * <pre>
 * if x&gt;=2 then x := x-2
 *         else x := x+2
 * </pre>
 * where beginning a block in front of the <code>then</code> can set the 
 * indentation level to the current position in the line without knowing how
 * much space the condition took up.  Indenting by 3 relative to the surrounding
 * block's indentation level would produce
 * <pre>
 * if x&gt;=2 then x := x-2
 *    else x := x+2
 * </pre>
 * no matter where in the first line the block was opened.
 * <p>
 * Some applications need to keep track of where certain parts of the input text
 * end up in the output. For this purpose, the Layouter class provides the
 * {@link #mark(Object)} method.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The public methods of this class may be divided into two categories: A small
 * number of <em>primitive</em> methods, as described above, and a host of
 * <em>convenience</em> methods which simplify calling the primitive ones for
 * often-used arguments. For instance, a call to {@link #beginC()} is shorthand
 * for <code>beginC(ind)</code>, where <code>ind</code> is the default
 * indentation selected when the Layouter was constructed.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Most of the methods can throw an {@link UnbalancedBlocksException}, which
 * indicates that the sequence of method calls was illegal, i.e. more blocks
 * were ended than begun, the Layouter is closed before all blocks are ended, a
 * break occurs outside of any block, etc.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The backend might throw exceptions of the type indicated by the type
 * parameter {@code Exc}. Such exceptions get passed through to the caller of
 * the Layouter. Note that since text usually gets buffered before it is sent to
 * the backend, exceptions thrown by calls to Layouter methods might not be
 * caused directly by that method call but by an earlier one getting forwarded
 * to the backend.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The algorithm used is essentially the classical one from Derek C. Oppen:
 * <i>Prettyprinting</i>, TOPLAS volume 2 number 4, ACM, 1980, pp. 465-483,
 * with some minor extensions. It has the property that if the input contains
 * enough actual text, i.e. not just arbitrarily long sequences of calls to
 * <code>beginC</code>, <code>mark</code>, etc., then pretty-printing uses
 * constant space, and time linear in the size of the input. In fact, output
 * will begin before the whole input has been given, so this class can be used
 * to pretty-print a stream of data.
 * 
 * @param <Exc>
 *            The type of exceptions that might be thrown by the backend.
